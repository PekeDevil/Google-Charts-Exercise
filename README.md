# Google-Charts-Exercise
This code allows you to download data from a ThingSpeak Channel and graph it using [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/). The data used is the %RAM and %CPU of a computer.

## What you need
* Notepad++: To write the code (you can use any type of text editor that allows you to save as .html, really).
* A ThingSpeak account: For this exercise we download the data for the Google Chart from a previously created [ThingSpeak Channel](https://thingspeak.com/).

## What to edit from the code
The type of chart used for this exercise is a [Line-Chart](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/linechart), so if you want to change the Chart type you should probably start there. Info can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/).

Apart from that, basic areas that should always be changed and adjusted to you own channel data as shown as follows [CAPITAL_LETTERS]. So Whenever you find [CAPITAL_LETTERS] change it to whatever is said. For Example: [CHANNEL FEED] should be changed to the the channel feed URI of you own channel. Same with [VARIABLE FIELD 01], etc.
